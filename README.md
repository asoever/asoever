## âœ¨ Hi! I am Anna Sophie
### A 26 year old Social Scientist from Germany ðŸŒ± âœ¨

I'm deeply interested in analyzing human behavior and thought to generate knowledge about social issues, lived realities, and social spaces â€“ aiming to contribute to a more just society. 

As the internet and social media have become their own kind of realm, distinct from our physical world, where we interact differently and follow unique norms, I believe it's all the more important to study these online social interactions using social data - which is why Iâ€™m committed to exploring the intersection between social sciences and social data science.

Just getting started with GitHub â€“ Stata files upcoming! Happy for any tips or feedback. ðŸŒ»ðŸŒ»
