## âœ¨ Hi! I am Anna Sophie ðŸŒ± 

I'm super curious about analyzing human behavior - to generate knowledge about social issues, lived realities, and social spaces. 

As the internet and social media have become their own kind of realm, distinct from our physical world, where we interact differently and follow unique norms, **I believe it's becoming more and more essential to study these online social interactions using social data** - which is why Iâ€™m committed to exploring the intersection between social sciences and data science.

Just getting started with GitHub â€“ Stata files upcoming! Happy for any tips or feedback. ðŸŒ»ðŸŒ»
